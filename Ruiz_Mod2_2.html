<p class="p4"><span class="s1">I was born and raised in Boca Raton, Florida. Growing up, I enjoyed playing outdoors and spent most of my time wandering on my own and getting in trouble for always disappearing somewhere. My childhood was filled with adventure and exploration, which shaped who I am today.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">\</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Currently, I am pursuing my studies at Bellevue University. I enjoy learning new technologies with the hope of applying them to a new career in software development. Outside of academics, I love reading, playing video games, and going to the theme parks in the Orlando area.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">\</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">I come from a slightly conservative close-knit family with traditional values, and we often gather for the holidays. Luckily this is pretty manageable considering there aren\'92t many of us. Family gatherings are always filled with laughter although my dad can sometimes sap some of the joy due to his OCD (which he denies that he has). But we still love him very much.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">\</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">In my free time, I like to explore the Orlando area and try to book as many trips both domestically and internationally as possible. Life is about trying new things and making the most of every opportunity with what little time we have.</span></p>
